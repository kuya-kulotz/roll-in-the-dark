# Roll in a Dark

My rendition of the Roll-a-ball tutorial from Unity Learn.
I was dead set to create my own game and this is the first tutorial that I learn from Unity Learn website. I finished the tutorial and wasn't satisfied to what I've done, so I refined it and this is what I've got.

I want to create a full game with an intro, a little story and at least some quests and secret quests in it. I got my inspirations from playing RPG games so the feel was a bit RPG-ish. I also want to have that little mini quests as well as hidden quests, where player need to explore to unlocked them. So that's what I integrated in this game. 

I kinda learn the basics and workflow for game development just by creating this game. I've watch some tutorials online, youtube channel as well as some tutorials in Unity Learn and the most important the help of Google search :D

I hope you enjoy this game. This is my first full featured game (at least with a title, game and outro. hahaha) and I hope you take the time explore the nitty gritty of the game. Its simple but I've added my twists on them. Again, it still need some improvements and if you have some comments on different ways to improve the game, please feel free to message me.

So just keep ROLLING and have fun! Thank you! :D
